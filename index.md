# **Briefly**

I am a Forest genetics researcher. I hold a BSc in Forestry Engineering and a MSc in Agroforestry Biotechnology at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, Spain. I am reading for a doctorate at the University of Oxford looking at the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry approach in non-native conifer UK populations.
 
 I'm a trees enthusiastic, can't walk two steps without trying to identify the trees around me.
 
 I've always engaged hiking and climbing, actually I enjoy every outdoors activity.
