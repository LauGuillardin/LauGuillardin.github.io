# **Briefly**


<img src="/img/IMG_20221024_235649_955.jpg" alt="Laura" style="width:200px;"/>

I am a Forest genetics researcher. I hold a BSc in Forestry Engineering and a MSc in Agroforestry Biotechnology at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, Spain. I am reading for a doctorate at the University of Oxford looking at the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry approach in non-native conifer UK populations.
 
 I'm a tree enthusiast, can't walk two steps without trying to identify the trees around me.
 
 I've always enjoyed hiking and climbing, I do enjoy every outdoor activity. At the moment more into indoor bouldering (may have to do with UK weather)
