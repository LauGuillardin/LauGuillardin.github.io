<p>I am a Forest genetics researcher. I hold a BSc in Forestry Engineering and a MSc in Agroforestry Biotechnology at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, Spain. I am reading for a doctorate at the University of Oxford looking at the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry approach in non-native conifer UK populations.</p>
<p> I&#39;m a tree enthusiast, can&#39;t walk two steps without trying to identify the trees around me.</p>
<p> I&#39;ve always enjoyed hiking and climbing, I do enjoy every outdoor activity. At the moment more into indoor bouldering (may have to do with UK weather)</p>
