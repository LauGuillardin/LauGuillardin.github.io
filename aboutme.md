I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. I graduated from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain) in a degree in Forestry Engineering in 2017, followed by an MSc in Agroforestry Biotechnology in 2018. Focusing both final BSc and MSc thesis on forestry genomic bioinformatics methods, I acquired skills in population genetics, genomic data analysis and data processing tools. 

My bachelor thesis was on genetic and phenotype analysis of European white oaks populations in the pre-pyrenean area by using population structure and landscape genomics approaches. During my master's thesis I focus on developing bioinformatics approaches for the genetic analysis of progenies of half brothers of holm oaks, cork oaks and hybrid individuals with the aim of use the plant material in breeding projects focused on the quality of cork. 

I spent the year after my MSc as a Junior Cloud Data Architect in an IT company in Madrid. I developed new skills to design and develop systems and frameworks that integrate Big Data, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics that provide a solution to a wide range of business challenges. 

Currently, I am a PhD student (3rd year) at the University of Oxford working on a project which aim is to assess the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry in non-native conifer UK populations.

When I'm not in the lab or trying to make sense of my data, I am climbing some rocks or playing basketball, lately I do love a bit of yoga (I might be aging a bit?). I'm into Yoko Ogawa a lot at the moment but I enjoy reading all sorts, especially distopias.
