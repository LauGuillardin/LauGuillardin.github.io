<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. I graduated from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain) in a degree in Forestry Engineering in 2017, followed by an MSc in Agroforestry Biotechnology in 2018. Focusing both final BSc and MSc thesis on forestry genomic bioinformatics methods, I acquired skills in population genetics, genomic data analysis and data processing tools. I spent the year after my MSc as a Junior Cloud Data Architect in an IT company in Madrid. I developed new skills to design and develop systems and frameworks that integrate Big Data, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics that provide a solution to a wide range of business challenges. Currently, I am a PhD student (3rd year) at the University of Oxford working on a project which aim is to assess the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry in non-native conifer UK populations.

Facts I get from what I do:

- I'm so lucky to carry on field work in awesome forests
- Tackling conservation issues on trees populations is crucial
- **Trees are amazing**
- Genomic level data analysis allows us to answer many questions
- Bioinformatics is a constant challenge no matter how much you think you master a software
- Sometimes I enjoy wet lab work
- Teaching and having students around in the lab/field is one of the best bits, Team Work is needed in academia environments
- Keep trying and eventually you'll get there
- Errors are essential for success

Things I do out of Academia:

I love sports and enjoy trying new things everytime I can. 
  * I have been playing basketball since I'm 6 years old. Currently playing for the University of Oxford W2 team.
  * Always enjoy a nice walk, preferable if we end up climbing something!
  * Love trying new sports, recently I've been trying surfing and can't wait to scubadive again! Always keen for some kayaking too

### I do love my dogs
