<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I graduated from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain) in a degree in Forestry Engineering in 2017, followed by an MSc in Agroforestry Biotechnology in 2018. Focusing both final BSc and MSc thesis on forestry genomic bioinformatics methods, I acquired skills in population genetics, genomic data analysis and data processing tools. I spent the year after my MSc as a Junior Cloud Data Architect in an IT company in Madrid. I developed new skills to design and develop systems and frameworks that integrate Big Data, Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics that provide a solution to a wide range of business challenges. Currently, I am a DPhil student (1st year) at the University of Oxford working on a project which aim is to assess the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry approach in non-native conifer UK populations.
