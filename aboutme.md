subtitle: Brief researcher biography
---

I studied a Forestry Engineering degree followed by an Agroforestry Biotechnology masters at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain. Focusing both final BSc and MSc thesis on forestry genomic bioinformatics methods, I acquired skills in population genetics, genomic data analysis and data processing tools. Currently, I am a DPhil student at the University of Oxford working on a project which aim is to assess the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry approach in non-native conifer UK populations. 

Things I most appreciate of my career:

- Field work in awesome forests
- Trees are amazing
- Genomic level data analysis allows us to answer A LOT of questions
- Bioinformatic challenges
- Sometimes I enjoy wet lab work

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
