<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I studied a Forestry Engineering degree followed by an Agroforestry Biotechnology masters at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid in Spain. Focusing both final BSc and MSc thesis on forestry genomic bioinformatics methods, I acquired skills in population genetics, genomic data analysis and data processing tools. Currently, I am a DPhil student at the University of Oxford working on a project which aim is to assess the genetic effects of applying Continuous Cover Forestry approach in non-native conifer UK populations.

Things I most appreciate of my job:

- Field work in awesome forests
- **Trees are amazing**
- Genomic level data analysis allows us to answer A LOT of questions
- Bioinformatic challenges
- Sometimes I enjoy wet lab work
