title: microGEM DNA extraction modified protocol - Western redcedar
category: [ Protocol ]
---
This is a modified protocol from the original MicroGEM PDQeX phytoGEM **DNA extraction** protocol provided by the manufacturer, [see link here](https://microgembio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/REV0-C0085-PDQeX-Handbook.pdf), [and here](https://microgembio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/QSG_009_190531_PDQeX-phytoGEM.pdf).


### The genomic isolation of _Thuja plicata_ - Western redcedar

#### Before starting

- Turn on the PDQeX and start the UV DNA auto-cleaning (it takes 30min).
- Add DNA-free water to **Histoslv** if starting a new bottle.
- Check where the tissuelyser adaptors are. If they are in the -80C freezer, take them out and rinse them with water, then leave them to dry.
- Get some ice from the ancillary room (next door on the right from our lab).
- Every centrifuge step at room temperature (14-25C).
- Completely thaw prepGEM and Histosolv, and mix by **gently inverting the tubes**. Remove 10XGREEN+ buffer and the Enhancer from the refrigerator and mix in the same way.
- Prepare a solution of 5XGREEN+ buffer in case we have run out.
- Prepare and label 24x2 2ml eppendorf tubes and x1 24-well plate

#### Caution

- Do not load the PDQeX machine if the control screen indicates a temperature above 40° C.
- Ensure the collection drawer and heating block are clean and DNA-free.
- Ensure the collection drawer is inserted as far as possible, and that it is straight.
- If fewer than 24 reactions are planned, make sure that the PCR tubes are placed in drawer wells corresponding to the channels to be used in the heating block

#### DNA extraction

1. **Samples selection** Take the samples from their envelopes (24) and add **≤10** mg of dried tissue per sample by using the precision balance in the small room, in a 2mL **eppendorf** with two tungsten beads (3mm).
3. **Disruption of the samples** Pipette 100ul of 5XGREEN+ buffer per sample. Use the TissueLyser for 1min at 30Hz (x2, reversing the position of the adaptors). Placed 12 samples per adaptor and be sure they are well balanced.
4. Vortex thoroughly and let the tube sit in a rack for 10 minutes.
5. **Prepare the Extraction pre-mix**:

|Reagent |ul (x1 sample)  | ul (24x samples + 0.1)
--- | --- | ---|
|Histosolv|15|396|
|Enhancer|10|264|
|PrepGEM|2|52.8|
|*DNA-free water*|25|660|

6. Mix the Extraction pre-mix by vortexing.
7. Pipette 52ul of the Extraction Mix into a new eppendorf tube.
8. **Add all the supernatant** to the tube by pipetting from the top (If they haven't had precipitated, centrifuge 1min 20000g).
9. Vortex and Spin down.
10. Transfer the solution into the PDQex catridges and put the cap on.
11. Load 24-well plate in the collection drawer and place it in the PDQeX first, then insert the catridges on the top (heating block).
12. Cover the cartridges with the hinged flap and close the sliding door.  

**MAKE SURE THE PDQeX CARTRIDGES CORRESPOND WITH A COLLECTION TUBE OR WELL - OTHERWISE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SAMPLE** (this really happened to me)  

13. Select the **plant** programme and **check the following conditions** are set up:

|Temperature (C) | Time (min)
--- | --- |
|52|15|
|75|10|
|95|2|

14. Extract and discard the catridges.
15. Take out the 24-well plate, seal it with a 36 Adhesive PCR plate sealer or with 8-strip caps. Check it's properly labelled.
16. **DNA is VERY FRAGILE**, do not vortex it. To mix it flick it gently and spin down. Store it at 4C if it is going to be used soon (same week), store at -20C for long term storage.
