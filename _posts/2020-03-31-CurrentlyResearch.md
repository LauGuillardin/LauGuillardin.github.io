**Abstract

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Even-aged plantations of non-native conifer species and clear-cutting silvicultural practices are widely used in UK forestry to maximize timber harvest yield. However, increasing concern for the future adaptability of forests and current policy promoting forests that support a full range of ecosystem services are leading to changes in forestry management. Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) is an approach to forest management based on the development of diverse stand structures composed of a mixture of species, managing the ecosystem rather than the trees and encouraging natural regeneration. While the transition to this type of woodland is a well defined silvicultural approach, there is a current paucity of studies on how the transmission of the gene pool from canopy trees to the next generation may affect the genetic diversity of future forest stands. The genetic diversity of non-native plantations may be lower compared to native woodlands. Moreover, the offspring of a population already lacking genetic diversity may be maladapted. The purpose of this project is to assess the genetic effects of applying CCF approach in non-native conifer UK populations. Therefore, we will compare genetic diversity parameters between canopy trees and natural regeneration both in native and non-native populations. The genetic diversity will be measured using a SNPs genotyping approach developed in a high-throughput microfluidic PCR amplification system. The integration of these results will be used to develop a set of recommendations for natural regeneration management in CCF populations.
