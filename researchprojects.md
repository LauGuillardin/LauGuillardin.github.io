Even-aged plantations of non-native conifer species and clear-cutting silvicultural practices are widely used in UK forestry to maximize timber harvest yield. However, increasing concern for the adaptability of forests to future and current environmental shifts is leading to changes in forestry management. Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) is an approach to managing forests based on the development of diverse stand structures composed of a mixture of species and encouraging natural regeneration while keeping a timber production aim. While the transition to this type of woodland is a well-defined silvicultural approach, there is a current paucity of studies on how the transmission of the gene pool from canopy trees to the next generation may affect the genetic diversity of future forest stands. The canopy that was planted may not show a large genetic diversity resulting in a poor gene pool being transmitted to the offspring resulting in forests lacking the ability to face potential environmental changes. To estimate how genetically diverse these plantations are, we will look at two species widely used for timber production in the UK and will genotype individuals from different strata to estimate how the gene pool is transferred. We will use available Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) datasets described previously in the literature for Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir ) and de novo SNP discovery in Thuja plicata (Western red cedar). Douglas-fir and Western red cedar SNP databases were filtered, and 96 SNPs were selected for further genotyping analysis. A SNPs genotyping approach was developed in a high-throughput microfluidic PCR system (Biomark system, Fluidigm®). We’ll validate the method by genotyping a subsample of Douglas-fir individuals using IPEX Gold massarray platform together with individuals from known provenance trials. The genotypic comparison between generations will shed light upon the vulnerability of such populations leading to the recommendation of comprehensive and effective genetic conservation strategies when needed.
